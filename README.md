MTG Deck Generation Suite
=========================
This is a simple tool to be used with Cockatrice. It generates a random deck through one of several different programs.

How to Use
----------
Python 3.X is required, as well as any version of Cockatrice.

1. Clone or download this repo

2. Download the AllCards.json file from https://mtgjson.com/ and put it in the same folder as the Python file

3. OPTIONAL: Change the `deck_path` variable in the Python file to your Cockatrice deck path

4. Run the Python file and select a program to run within it

5. The deck will be saved as "ZZZCreated Deck.cod" in the folder specified by `deck_path`, or in the same folder as the Python file if you skipped step 3
