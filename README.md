MTG Deck Generation Suite
=========================
This is a simple tool to be used with Cockatrice. It generates a random deck through one of several different programs.

How to Use
----------
The suite is currently only tested and supported on Windows, the main platform for Cockatrice. Python 3.X is required.
1. Download the Python file and put it in a folder anywhere
2. Download the AllCards.json file from https://mtgjson.com/ and put it in the same folder as the Python file
3. Run the Python file and select a program to run within it
4. The deck will be saved as "ZZZCreated Deck.cod" in the same folder as your other Cockatrice decks
